# Testing React Nested Routing

Done in both reactjs and react-native

In this project I've declared a route in the App component which creates a route to the FirstView component.

My problem is I'm trying to create a route within the FirstView Component to the ChildView component and redirect to it.

The redirection only works when I declare the ChildView route within the App component
